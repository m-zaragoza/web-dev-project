## About this project
-----
This project was created by Robyn Clarke (https://github.com/Robyn-Clarke) and myself as the final project for the course _Introduction to Web Development_, by Code First Girls. 

We created this website at the very beginning of my coding journey, in May 2022.

### Review
-----
While working on this project I got a first contact with tools like VS 
Code and GitHub. I got to explore Bootstrap and play with flexbox, and used resources like Google Fonts and Font Awesome.\
The end result is not what it would be if I were to do this project again today but, considering I had just scrapped the surface of what's possible in the world of web dev, I'm proud of it.
